Introduction
============

The OpsBridge Upgrade Version Check Tool is an evolving set of utilities that are designed to help simply the process of upgrading OpsBridge 
by aiding the identification of installed components and the configuration of the product. 
Where appropriate, issues will be highlighted (such as where a component version is no longer supported).
The current version of the tool is supporting classic OBM/OMi versions 10.12 or higher.

More detailed information is contained in the Micro_Focus_Operations_Bridge_opr-version-check.pdf document which is packaged with the scripts. 
This ReadMe is a "quick start" guide for the APM script.


Basic Concept
=============

The tool consists of several perl scripts that can be executed on either Linux or Windows platforms. 
The OBR script can be executed locally on an OBR server (Windows or Linux) or remotely if the OBR capture tool has been previously executed. The OBR capture tool is documented here:

https://docs.microfocus.com/itom/Operations_Bridge_Reporter:10.40/Troubleshoot/Troubleshooting_SHR/Capture

This must have been configured before the run-obr-checks.pl script can be used.

Distribution Files
==================

Along with this ReadMe, the perl files are packaged in a zip file that can be extracted on Windows or Linux. 
The directory structure is explained in more detail in the Word document, but it is important when unpacking the zip file that this directory structure is preserved. 
Most of the scripts share some common libraries in perl modules that are referenced through that directory structure.


Running Perl Scripts
====================

Perl is available on both Windows and Linux platforms, but is not usually installed on Windows. 
To run these scripts on Windows, a perl engine such as ActivePerl is required or the Micro Focus Operations Agent provides a perl engine 
which can be used instead (a batch file "oaperl.bat" is provided in this package and this locates the Operations Agent perl engine if it is present). 
On Linux, perl is more commonly installed and available - but if it is not already present, it can be installed (for example using "yum install perl -y").


Running the OBR Script
======================

The OBR script (run-obr-checks.pl) can be executed locally on an OBR Gateway server (with the Capture tool installed) or remotely using the ouput from the Capture tool. 

The input for script:

-zipfile <filename> 	The zipfile generated by the capture tool. If ommited then the capture tool will be invoked by the script

Example:

	./run-obr-checks.pl

This assumes that the script is running on the Gateway server on Linux and the admin user is being used. Database checks will not be made.

	c:\>perl c:\scripts\run-apm-checks.pl -pwd P@ssword -dbpwd P@ssword2

This assumes that the script is running on the Gateway server on Linux. Database checks will be made.
